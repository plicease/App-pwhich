# PODNAME: pwhich
# ABSTRACT: Pure Perl implementation of which
# VERSION

exit App::pwhich::main(@ARGV);

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ pwhich perl
 $ pwhich -a perl          # print all matches
 $ pwhich perl perldoc ... # look for multiple programs
 $ pwhich -a perl perldoc ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pwhich> is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
programs based on the user's C<PATH>. It is similar to the usually Unix
tool `which', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
purely in Perl (uses the module C<File::Which>), so is portable.

=head2 Calling syntax

 $ pwhich [-a] [-v] programname [programname ...]

=head2 Options

=over

=item -a

The option I<-a> will make C<pwhich> print all matches found in the
C<PATH> variable instead of just the first one. Each match is printed
on a separate line.

=item -v

Prints version (of C<File::Which>) and copyright notice and exits.
